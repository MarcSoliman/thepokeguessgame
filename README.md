This is a Pokemon Trivia Game created utilizing the React framework NextJS, as well as PokeAPI for the Pokemon Data.

## What I Learned

Creating this web app from beginning to end taught me and reinforced many important web development concepts. I created the design in Figma first and quickly learned that creating a design key helped a ton with coding the visuals. 

I then focused on the logic of the web app, and by using the PokeAPI as my api of choice and axios, I was able to read and use all the data I needed about all of the avilable Pokemon. Utilizing NextJs/s built-in backend solution, I also got in the good habit to use .env.local files in order to store my api key (in this case this is the public PokeAPI key, but this was done to reinforce best-practicies to simulate an industry situation)
